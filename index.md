# The Life of "Tools"  
*WIP*

---

The life of the "human+extension" organism traces its lineage all the way back to *Lucy+Stones*. A convenient starting point until the archeologists tell us otherwise. From that point on, humans and "tools" were mutually adaptive on a variety of social, cognitive, economic and environmental levels.

A fundamental linguistic and conceptual obstacle stems from the notion of "isness", which obscures process, hides the spectrum of life, and separates mutuality unneccesarily into distinct components. There are other semantic primitive notions that do the same[^1].
